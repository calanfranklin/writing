Soon enough Mr. Gathinus. Pasted to a chair behind the table. Through the door behind him is the school cafeteria, and behind that is the gymnasium, lined up with tables, chessboards, and chairs for the tournament. To the right of the gymnasium and outside the doors is the parking lot. There Charis’s militia prep rifles and line up the black bags for blinding our heads.

My mother stares at Mr. Gathinus. Her leg bounces and she taps her fingers against her hip. Each second another inch of hellfire stacks on her and her eyebrows come down a little further. Quite a few times now I’ve seen her about to speak but she’s stopped and clamped her lips closed and put her hand over her mouth. Then she pretends to yawn.

But Mr. Gathinus keeps staring at the clipboard, fidgeting with his pen. My mother bends over the desk, adjusting her posture until her shadow covers part of his clipboard. People behind us peer around each other’s backs, staring. Maybe Mr. Gathinus can’t hear my mother there over the pressurization of his lungs coming up and down and out his open mouth. Maybe he can’t see her because he’s asleep.

“Name?” Mr. Gathinus looks at me a moment, then sticks his swollen eyes to his clipboard, his breathing cycling.

“Victoria Estera,” my mother says.

“No. No, for goodness’ sake. Quiet. Not from you. If I’d wanted to hear from you, I’d have asked you, won’t I have? Seems logical I would have.”

“I speak on her behalf. I'm her mother—I speak on her behalf. Who are you to tell me my business?”

“Christ in hell.” Mr. Gathinus crosses himself then mimes tossing the cross away. “I do not, repeat, do not care one drop if you are her mother, grandmother, sister, or lawyer. Don’t care if you’re her conjoined twin. The girl can think can she not? So she speaks for herself and is not spoken for, understand?”

“You… you can’t treat me like this. Don’t you understand? You cannot… cannot do this… you fucking imbecile! You cannot treat me in this manner. Are you retarded? Slow? Downs? You are, aren’t you? I can see it on your lips. Poor creature. Like some kind of animal, you are. Mother must never have loved you properly, did she?”

Mr. Gathinus runs his finger through his clipboard. Then he sets it down. He crosses his arms back in his chair and stares at his feet. Reaches for his pocket, takes a pack of gum, unwraps, shoves a stick in his mouth, and chews.

I look at my mother. Her skin is red, dulled horns sprouting from her forehead. I want to strangle her but before I begin to reach for her, her face returns to the face of the woman that had raised me.

“Oh, I’m so rude, so stupid. Sincerest, my most, absolute sincerest apologies, sir. I thought you were someone else. Really. I thought that you were my… husband.” My mother bites her lips and her nose twitches and her nails dig into the scars on her palms.

“Whatever. Treacherous woman, your mother. Always thought so. Name?” Mr. Gathinus asks.

“Victoria Estera,” I say.

Mr. Gathinus drags his finger through all the names again, flipping through laminated pages and licking the tips of his dehydrated fingers until he finds mine. “Alright, that’s very good. I’m glad you registered. Suppose you are aware of the rules of the tournament, too, then?”

“Of course she is, what a demented question to ask such an intelligent progenitor as my daughter—”

“If you don't let the young lady speak, then you're going to have to get out of here, and she won’t be able to participate anymore. I can say the word on this day and have you arrested. No one here wants that trouble—trouble it would be, the paperwork, and God I’m a fucking volunteer—so goodness, good God if you please could shut up woman and let us all do our jobs.” He crosses himself again, throws away the heavy burden.

My mother makes a small yipping noise, sucking in air. Sharp sounds play on her vocal cords, words begin to form out her lips.

“Yes, I know the rules.” My mother deflates hearing my voice. I cradle her cold hand in mine while keeping my eyes on Mr. Gathinus.

“Now let us get it straight,” Mr. Gathinus says. “The award money is yours. Not your mother’s, not your father’s. Not your siblings. Not any person who might have put you up and told you they get a cut. If you win, it will be held for you in a savings account until you turn eighteen. Is this very clear? So clear that you understand and will not come later looking for me and trouble with lawyers and yadda yadda complaining and complaining?”

I look at my mother. She nods.

“Yes,” I say.

“No no, goodness. You’d think… you’d think… You looked at your mother. Do you know? Or are you saying you do because your mother says? Do you know what is at stake here this day?”

“I know about the rules. I went here. For school, I went here.”

“Good. Then you do know, correct? Nothing to clarify?”

“Yes.”

“And you participate of your own free will, without coercion? You say now to me, and you don’t go here today. Then if your mother or anyone gives you trouble we can order a police officer to—”

“I know. I want to.”

_Never mind,_ I’m about to say. _Never mind. I don__’t want to, I misspoke._

Cake, ice cream, sugar. A fine dinner, expensive but modest. Music playing and my family smiling. Telling me how proud they are of me. Admiring me from now on, like an equal. _No._ Like a superior. _And this is all it takes. All I have to do is win._

A smile comes but I hide it by turning away to the parking lot and putting my hand to my mouth like I’m looking at my mental schedule and ensuring I’ve got nothing important going on today.

“Excellent. Very excellent. You can have your mother with you, but if she says words at the match or if you two communicate—”

“I know,” I say.

#

I wait at one of the tables. My name card in front of me. My mother socializes with the other parents, old friends she could not miss the opportunity to mingle with.

People filter around me. The last chunk of sunlight coming through the window. Soon the light will fade, and if I get home today, it will be just before dark.

A young man. He’s not tall. Smells like stale clothing and cumin mixed with cigarette ash. The smell trails up my nostrils and coats my lungs, sedimenting in my chest. He sits next to me and the smell solidifies. I read his name card: Seyyed Kingston. His father collapses into the seat next to him.

I look at the number underneath Seyyed’s name. The same as mine. My opponent.

“You’re nervous?” Seyyed asks.

“Yes,” I say.

“One of us won’t… one will lose. Isn’t that funny?”

“Could get a draw.”

“We won’t draw.”

“Can’t say for certain, can you?”

“That’s right… you’re right I never thought of that. Can’t say for certain. But I have that sensation in my brain screaming at me otherwise. Won’t draw. Not going to happen today. Can’t be that lucky. Wouldn’t it be nice?” He fiddles with his fingers. Straightens the wrinkles out of his pants.

“You know they’re listening.”

“I—I wasn’t… wasn’t proposing we rig anything. I should rephrase. Should… stop talking. It’s just I’d be glad to lose to serve our country. Be equally as glad to win but I’m here for… Here for my family. They get the money if I win. Both ways they get money. You see?”

“Just play your best.”

“Yes. You’re right. It’s just a game. I’m not here to fight against you nor are you me. Right? We’re just—we’ve just happened to be put together, squished together so that we have to fight. But we both want the same thing—to win. We don’t necessarily want to see the other… don’t want to see them lose, but we both want to win, and we don’t live in a perfect world, do we?”

“No. We don’t. But we live in a better world than most.”

“Well. Maybe not.”

“He will win,” Seyyed’s father says. “You will lose.”

“It’s possible,” I say.

His father leans forward. “Yes, maybe. Which is why I say it with such certainty. You will lose. Of the thousands of possibilities the most likely is you lose. Plain and simple.”

“My father doesn’t have anything against you,” Seyyed says.

“I wouldn’t really care if he did. I don’t really have anything against either of you but we don’t have to like each other.”

“Didn’t have to be rude.” Seyyed shifts his head away.

“I didn’t mean to. So I’m not sorry if it seemed that way.”

“You didn’t mean to.”

I watch the clock. Thirty minutes to the hour. _Thirty minutes of sitting here._

“I’m sorry I reacted that way,” Seyyed says.

“What way?”

“Mean.”

“I don’t care what way you react, Seyyed.”

“It’s a shame we have to fight each other.”

“You already said that.”

“Just talking. To pass time. Talking because I don’t know what else…”

“Why are you here?”

“Me? I already told you.”

“Beyond for your family and that. Why?”

He puts his hands on the table then back onto his knees. He runs his fingers through his hair, fondles his name card.

“Don’t tell her anymore Seyyed,” his father says. “It’s not her business.”

_His reason is the same as mine at the end of it isn__’t it? Pressure. Desire._

Seyyed breathes, looks at me. “I don’t really have a proper reason beyond family.”

“Takes a lot of work to get through those doors,” I say. “A lot of pressure.”

“Don’t have a reason. Can’t tell you.”

“Can’t or don’t really want to? No point in being cold-footed if we’re not gonna see each other after today.”

He quiets, turns his whole force away from me. My mother comes and sits at the table, her scent of clean lint and flower petals sopping up the kitchen odour emanating from Seyyed and his father.

“Who are your friends?” my mother asks.

“They’re not my friends,” I say.

#

I stare at the minute hand on my watch and count the seconds. Cloudy voices covered by the ticking hand, only five minutes to the top of the hour. I block the minute hand with my finger. Close my eyes. Push the hand backward.

But the hand touches the top and the buzzer sounds. I look around at everyone, at the clock on the wall. They stumble out of their seats, stretching, wrapping arms around family, wishing luck in breaths and quieting as they resign to their assigned seats and tables.

I get up. Blood sinks to my legs and I waver hard, feeling my consciousness splice with the air. But I breathe in and the air restores me. I hug my mother and her chin pinches my shoulder. I go to my spot.

The moderator lurks above my head. His skin is bone-textured, his eyes attached to that skin wide and brown. Slight chocolate specs around his mouth, candy wrappers crinkling in his breast pocket.

He produces a coin once Seyyed comes and sits at the table.

“Call it,” the moderator says.

“Tails,” Seyyed says.

The moderator flips the coin, lunges for it in the air then slams it onto the back of his palm. He smiles. He glances at the coin’s face and spins the chessboard around so the black pieces are on my side and the white on Seyyed’s.

Seyyed’s eyes dart away when I look at him. His obese father stands further back, biting his nails, turning his head and watching the players at the other chessboards then snapping back to ours.

The buzzer sounds and Seyyed outstretches his hand to me and I stare before shooting my own out with my heart squeezing. Seyyed slaps the timer and moves a piece and slaps the timer again. The seconds tick and tick down. I’ve hardly blinked twice. Ten sink away, then my whole body motions toward the board, focusing on each piece.

I look at my mother behind me but all the muscles in her face and body are motionless. All I see is the tenseness and contraction of her eyes, the marble figure brought free by her makeup.

The moderator brings the full form of his face onto me. He points with his eyes at the chessboard.

I stare at the board. Imagine the pieces going forward, search for routes, openings, the way to gain the upper hand. Nothing. Over a thousand games played in my life yet in my mind I move a piece, predict where he will move his. I move again, my brain seizes and all I see are the mines and farms, cold smoke through chimneys, black blistered fingers struggling to piece together munitions. Bread filled with sand and rocks coupled with lead-lined water to wash it down. Fourteen hour days. Cots made of steel wool.

_How much time has past?_ I bring my eyes back to the board, back to the clear image of reality. Seyyed biting his nails and lips, eyes collected and watching my fingers. His father, arms still crossed over his stomach, glancing at the timer and me and his son.

I look at the clock and watch the numbers drain. Plastic tubing sprouts from that clock and sucks my blood. Each second another ounce out my body, another pound of weakness staked in my heart. I blink and the tubes turn to grains on the wood. I scratch where the needle linking into my veins had been in my arm. Look back at the clock. Numbers have dripped in dozens.

I stare at the one moved piece on the board, at Seyyed with his left hand now clutching his right, his glasses glued on the tip of his nose. My hand starts to move. One of my pieces drift forward on the board. I hit the timer and Seyyed’s eyes stretch and he starts to huff.

He stops clutching his hands together and hovers one over the board and his tendons shake. He keeps wiping a finger along the sweat on his forehead and sometimes he grabs and tugs on his earlobe. _Is he ever going to play? Ever? He__’s going to throw up._ At that, nausea infects my throat and for a moment I feel the acid on my tongue and in my nose. I grapple my nails into my thigh and focus on the pinching and pain till my eyes are clear and my throat less swollen.

Seyyed makes his move and slaps the timer.

I stare at the board then pick up another piece and hit the clock. Seyyed’s eyes stop shaking around and his hands, as he moves from hovering over one piece to the next, don’t waver. He makes another move before my heart beats. Sweat on the line of my forehead.

I look at all the people around me. At each table, each pair of people, each moderator, Seyyed’s father, my mother. I look at them and the walls of my living room start to crack out of the ground. The floors spreading into carpet and to the right of me stairs. Seyyed’s face shifts into the blurred image of my father and the light on his face and all around goes from fluorescent to a cool yellow. Even the diffuser-puffed chamomile clings like vinegar in the air.

I search for my father’s voice as I reach and bring up my next piece. Search for his warning, for the sharp inhale of his breath and the beginning of his words to tell me I’m making a mistake. But silence. My heart failing in my throat. I make my move, hit the timer. I watch my father make his move, studying.

I make another move. Reaching for my father’s advice, reaching for what my father would say on the other side of the board. I breathe in. Clarity clears the chamomile smell from my lungs and the walls of my living room fade. I keep playing. Each piece feels heavier in my fingers. _Don__’t drop them. Don’t._ Ash and smoke and calloused, sore hands coming for me, chasing me along putrid fields.

The time running down. _My time. The time I have left on this earth on that clock. I am having a heart attack. Social death. Social death._

I breathe in deep, breathe out deep. The board is fuzzy and I wait for it to come into focus but it keeps sitting there, like a face underwater or in a dream. _My time. Leaving my body._

I look to make a move and to keep my clock alive but I can’t stop my eyes from going back to the clock. _When it hits zero I won__’t have to worry anymore._

I pick up a drudgy piece and force with my tendons to make my move.

The buzzer prongs my ears. The pieces lock in, rigid. The small light on Seyyed’s side is red. Mine has gone green. I scan the board a few times, put my hand to my heart. No matter if my hand is on my shoulder or my forehead or anywhere I feel my heart and sweat and shaking. _I lost._ The light is green on my side. _There must be some mistake. Seyyed must have won._

Seyyed stares at his feet. His mouth hangs open and his eyes sag. _Is he dead?_

He wipes his face, gains motion. His father behind him, cheeks puffy and the blood vessels in his eyes seem to glow. His hands tense in fists. His lips form a swear under his breath. _Why are you so angry at me?_ I follow and restudy the path of his eyes.

They dig into Seyyed’s back.

My mother behind me. The light pressure of her hand on my shoulder rises in my skin. I try to raise my hand to hold hers but my hands only twitch when I try to move them. Seyyed sits with his head in his hands as the rest of the contenders finish their games.

I keep away from the faces of anyone else in the room. _They__’re not real people._ Watch the clock. The seconds wrap around my neck. _Not home yet._

The speakers sound. The last player has finished. “Losers of round one must please report to the parking lot. All others, please enjoy a delicious refreshment while you wait.”

Refreshments. _I__’m going to throw up—going to throw up._ A serving cart pushes through the doors leading to the cafeteria. Carrying danishes. Donuts from the bakery. A fondue fountain and fresh fruit. A pile of plastic cups next to a beverage dispenser. Everything in neat lines and stacks and the tablecloth unwrinkled.

I look back to Seyyed’s chair and when I see the chair empty a hammer drives ice into my liver. The shock shudders my being and I try to pull out the ice but can’t and I bring my hands over my face and cover my eyes with darkness. _It could have been me._ I look again at the chair, at all the chess tables and all the moderators and people coating the walls.

I slap myself. Everyone in the room looks for a second. I retreat into my hands again but I peak through my fingers and see that nobody looks anymore.

My shoulder feels empty. I reach up for my mother’s hand but it isn’t there anymore. I scan for her. She’s speaking with Seyyed Kingston’s father. Her cheeks shine and the makeup around her eyes is mushy and spoiled. Seyyed’s father keeps looking at my mother’s neck and bringing his hands up to choke her but each time he settles for patting her on the shoulder and hugging her.

I stand and turn to the spread of food and pick up a donut and take a bite that is too large for my mouth but I chew and chew and chew till I can get it down then I take another. I grab a plastic cup and watch as juice pours in. I bring the cup to my lips, sip, swirl the liquid in my mouth and gulp it down and set the cup and my unfinished donut on the table.

I look at my hands. _I did it. Won._

#

A bus parked in the lot. Tinted windows, unmarked. White. Silver trim at parts. Can just make out the bars and metal on the other side of the glass. The bus’s engine idles, rumbling the ground. Outside, the air smells of cold water sapped and pumped from a storm drain and to get that smell out of my mouth, I watch a few crows tremble out of a tree.

The bus. _Seyyed is in there._ I trace my eyes along each window. _He must be looking at me. Does he hate me?_ Nowhere. _He__’s got a bag over his head. You watched them put them on, sheath them over their tear-stained heads and march them over into the bus. You watched that. He can’t see you. Won’t ever see you._

A soldier of Charis standing with a rifle at the door. _Strange how they never move. Never blink._ _Never eat or drink. But when they do move they move like animals._ My cousin touched one once and had to spend a week in the emergency room reconstructing his hand. Flew in a specialist it was so bad. Pins and screws and stitches all along, hand looked like a swollen, rotting chicken breast.

I watch the soldier of Charis’s chest, try to catch his breathing. Nothing. _He__’s looking at me. But his eyes are straight. What would happen if I touched his gun? Would he kill me? Do they guard the untouchables forever? Eat or drink? Are they alive?_

“Shouldn’t stare at them.”

I twist, look up while fighting a spark of vomit. Seyyed Kingston’s father. _Does he want to murder me?_ I dig in his eyes. He’s tired. No moisture on the whites or at the edges or in his hair. Bags on his eyes due either to his complexion or insomnia or present stress.

“I know,” he says. “You are afraid of me. With all these people around, with a Charis dog there, you are still afraid. Why do you think they stand guard? Conflicts between people like us. You’re trembling. Your fingers. Cold?”

“Yes, I’m cold as hell.”

“Cold because you’re nervous?”

“Yes. And no. Everyone’s cold when they’re nervous. Also cold when they’re hungry.”

“Never met a girl as lost as you and I think neither have you. You speak to fill the void, right? Well. Would you tell me, where is your mother?”

The crowd. I search for her face. Nowhere, not socializing in some corner, not laughing her sharp, embarrassing laugh.

Seyyed’s father nods. “And if it were you on the bus, would she be here? I’m here for my son. Though he might not be able to see me. But thank you dearly for paying him respect and all the others respect. The crowd is much smaller. Many have gone home.”

“I didn’t even think of going home.”

“Why would you? What is there for you?”

“Watch your—why are you…”

“Why else would you be here? You remember what I said about my son winning? How he would win? He has won. Because he’s cemented himself there.” Seyyed’s father points to the plaques. The names of the untouchables. “He’s cemented himself as a hero to our family and our country and he will remain in that form forever. What have you done? What have you ever done for your family or your country? Did you even believe you’d lose?”

“Get out of my sight. Please. Get the fuck out of my sight you…”

His cheeks sink. He wipes his eye with a thick finger, turns and steps away from me, not before mumbling an unknown word.

I suck in air and search for distraction while the moderators set up the microphone.

“Look at that stenciling. Such fine craftsmanship.” They’re talking about the plaques on the wall of the school. One of the plaques has my grandfather’s name. I don’t recognize the voices and I stick my eyes to the bus, crawling through the tint for the image of Seyyed.

“Who made it?”

“Believe Dora Aspen. Shop downtown.”

“I hope she didn’t cheap out on the varnish this year. Last thing these people need is to be disrespected like that. But that’s what you get for going local. Should have someone really professional do it. That’d be great, wouldn’t it?”

“Shut the goddamned fuck up, Haley,” I say. “Shut your village cunt mouth. Only time you ever stop talking is with a cock in your mouth.”

They’re whispering about me and some stare. They close their backs to me. Mothers and fathers cover their children’s ears and protect them behind their legs. I walk away from the crowd. Stand by the dumpster.

Not long after, Margaretha Meyer goes to the microphone and starts to sing the Canadian anthem.

Our singing is a quiet, hesitant tickle on the first few lines. Our voices grow and muscle memory takes over at every turn of pitch and meter. I sing louder, as loud as I can to the point where my throat feels like sandpaper. Margaretha finishes. A streak of eye shadow runs on her cheek. We clap for her though I did most of the work.

One of the moderators comes to the microphone. “Thank you Margaretha that was lovely. Now, please shift your attention to those brave people on the bus. We thank them for their service, and wish them good luck in their new lives of strengthening the foundations of our state.”

Seyyed’s father wipes his eyes and blubbers. I search for motion through the black tint. Still nothing.

The engine roars louder and the gear shifts and air hisses and the bus rolls through the parking lot. Turn signal comes on. The bus melds with the road and soon turns out of vision.

The moderator comes, hands me a ribbon sewn with golden text.  
  

VICTORIA ESTERA

VICTOR OF CHARIS

NOVEMBER 2022

#

My father sits on the porch. His face lit by a reading light and the dying pink glow of the sun stretching over the mountains. Wind touches the sidewalk, music and barking dogs sound somewhere distant. The walk here was short but long enough for my legs to be sore. Long enough for my mother to not have answered what I asked her.

“Victoria, you’re home.” My father stands from the chair, sets his book on the table. “I guess that would mean…”

“I won.”

“You won?”

“Yes.”

“Say it again and let it sink in.”

“I won.”

“Feel any different?”

“Feel like I want to go to bed.”

My father laughs. “Don’t I understand that. Go on inside. You well earned it, sweet pea. But tomorrow we practice. Your mother told me over the phone that you were… well… You had a little bit of issue.”

I turn and look at my mother. Look at my father on the porch. Heart pumping, my skin boiling and red.

_Is that where you were you whore? And where would he be if I’d lost? Still on this porch? Would either of you even have watched the bus leave?_

“She told you?” I ask.

“Yes. It’s not a big deal, Victoria. It just means we have to practice. And practice harder.”

“What if I want to take a week off. No practice. What if I don’t want to play. It’s not fun anymore. Won’t ever be fun again.”

“It’s not meant to be fun, Victoria.”

“You told me it was.”

“When?”

“When I was younger.”

“I don’t remember saying that. Doesn’t sound like me. Sounds like your grandfather. Besides. Not what I’m saying now. We’re playing to win, Victoria. Playing for you to be a star. You got five thousand dollars today but we gotta think bigger. Ten thousand next time. Hundred thousand one day. You’re playing to be the best in the world. That’s a big thing. And you won’t get there by taking a week off.”

“I don’t want to play tomorrow. I want to do nothing tomorrow.”

“We’ll talk about that tomorrow. You rest up, sweetie pie.”

“No. We’ll talk about it never. I won’t play.”

“You’ll play. Of course you will.”

“No.”

My father sits in the chair. The seat squeaks as it rocks back and forth. He opens his book. His eyes don’t move along the words. Chair keeps on squeaking.

I look at the front door. My mother shakes her head at me, goes up to the door, goes inside. I follow her. The whole right side of my body pulses with swelling heat, prepping for my father’s voice to pounce on me. But he still stares at his book. Rocking. His reading glasses hanging off his neck.

I manage the door closed and enter the cool room.

My mother crosses her arms. “You are a piece of work, Victoria. He works hard all day and comes home to _you._ You appreciate nothing you’re given. All we’ve done for you.”

“Okay.” I take off my shoes, my jacket. Take the first few steps up the stairs. “Now will you answer my question?”

“No. Of course I love you. Of course I would have been there. But… but Victoria, it would have been better on all of us if you’d lost.”

I stop. “I’ll give you an opportunity to take that back.”

“The remittance. Could’ve traveled, could’ve done so much more without you. We would have adopted, later, to make up for it. But it would have been so much—” She sees my eyes, pretends she had not been speaking at all. She wipes tears or corrects her eyelashes. Then she scurries down the hall to the wine cabinet.

I hear the cork popping when I reach the top of the stairs. I go to my room, fall on the bed. Stare at the ceiling.

_Money in my savings account. Five-thousand dollars. Access in a few weeks when I turn eighteen. Leave home, start schooling._

_Leave home, start schooling. Leave home_…

Start a new life.
